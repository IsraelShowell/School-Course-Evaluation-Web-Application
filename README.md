# Project: School-Course-Evaluation System
# Version: 1.10

# Description:
This is a Web application where a user can register an account with a username and password, login into their account, and make an evaluation on a course.
An admin can login and view completed evaluations submitted by users.
This Web application uses SQLite as its database system, HTML/CSS Front-End, and Python as its Back-End. <br>
This Web application is a way for me to practice Flask development, linking HTML/CSS Front-End to Python Back-End, creating a practical program,
reusing old software, and database management actions including, but not limited to; 

- Accessing databases 
- Creating tables inside databases 
- Inserting data into the tables 
- Checking the contents of tables
- Connecting Front-Ends and Back-Ends together
- Developing Web Applications
- Software Reuse; Primialy Component and Unit reuse
